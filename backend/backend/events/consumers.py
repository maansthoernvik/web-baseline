INFO

* self.scope will contain much the same information as that you can find in a request object in a Django view.
* connect can raise AcceptConnection or DenyConnection exceptions
* In order to use groups for multicast messages you have to add a channel backend that is able to handle it. 
  RedisChannelLayer is one such handler, add it as BACKEND in settings.py in the var 
  CHANNEL_LAYERS['default']['BACKEND'].
* You can make a consumer automatically join a group upon connection by specifying the class variable groups. Groups
  has to be an iterable. The group will also be automatically dropped on disconnection.
